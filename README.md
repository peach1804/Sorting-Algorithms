# Sorting-Algorithms

This program sorts 3 arrays of size _x_ of random integers between 10,000 and 10,000,000 _y_ times using Merge Sort, Quick Sort and Heap Sort.

The time taken to sort each array is recorded and exported to a csv file.

The size of the arrays (_x_) and the number of iterations (_y_) can be changed in the main method.
